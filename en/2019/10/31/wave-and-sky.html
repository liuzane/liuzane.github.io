The author Zhuge Yiding once served in the navy.<br><img src="/images/reprints/wave-and-sky/bg401102.jpg"></p><h3 id="Preface"><a href="#Preface" class="headerlink" title="Preface"></a>Preface</h3><p>Whenever night falls, looking at the vast sea and the merchant ships coming and going, what a peaceful scene. Only they, those navy brothers who sail the seas for national interests in not-so-advanced ships, know how hard-won all this is. In peacetime, my brothers work silently, some sacrificing their young lives. Behind this seemingly peaceful scene, what kind of stories might there be?</p><p>I once visited the home of a fallen brother. He was once my diving instructor, who sacrificed his life during a special mission when his diving equipment got entangled in fishing nets and he couldn’t free himself. When I went to his home and saw his elderly, frail parents and his young child who didn’t understand, I couldn’t say a word of the comforting words I had prepared in advance. All comfort was superfluous. Chinese civilians are too great.</p><p>Due to the nature of my work, I never visited the homes of martyrs again. Every year on Qingming Festival, as long as I’m not at sea, I go with other brothers to the place the martyr loved most - the high mountain by the military port, looking in the direction where he sacrificed himself, silently praying for him in my heart. I think that one day his wish can be fulfilled.<br><img src="/images/reprints/wave-and-sky/bg401101.jpg"></p><h3 id="Personnel-Division"><a href="#Personnel-Division" class="headerlink" title="Personnel Division"></a>Personnel Division</h3><p>When ships are sailing at sea, the navigation department is generally responsible for maintaining ship position and course, and drawing navigation charts and filling out navigation logs are also their specialties. Don’t underestimate the filling out of navigation logs - they are important documents that will be archived later. Since the brothers in the navigation department mostly work above deck, they are the first to get seasick when encountering strong winds and waves.</p><p>The observation and communication department is the eyes of a warship. Radar, sonar, signals, meteorology, and radio are all under their jurisdiction. If you have a buddy in the observation and communication department, you can use the gaps between watches to increase your vision thousands of times. Remember, this is not something you can brag about. Their work environment is often very clean, but the signalman’s place is not so great. Although he can often stand above the captain’s head, looking down and commenting on the captain, it’s very dangerous. The principle of “being close to the king is like being close to a tiger” - I think everyone understands. To avoid falling into the sea, they often tie themselves to the railing with ropes. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy of signals is also a heavy burden on their shoulders. If you go to the military port early or late, you can often see them flashing signals that only they understand. Hand flag signals are even more amusing - you see them waving hand flags, muttering: “Glass, auntie, pumpkin, hope…” They also have civilian skills that no one can match. I advise everyone not to play cards with two of them at the same time - you definitely won’t win. Their eyes are like signal lights, blinking and making you feel uncomfortable all over. Don’t believe me? Try it.</p><p>The missile department is the treasure of the ship. Whether those big guys can be launched depends on them. Don’t look at them being casual usually, but when the battle alarm sounds, they’re all serious. The hard work of the gun department is recognized by everyone. Many heavy tasks on warships can’t escape them - who let them be tall and strong? They are also major consumers of ammunition. One external gun target practice might consume more ammunition than army brothers use in several years. I once helped them carry ammunition to a gun position, getting dizzy and exhausted just to exchange an empty shell casing. Not worth it - everyone should definitely not do such things.</p><p>The ship service department is in charge of ship logistics, with the highest leader being the ship service officer. Local vegetable vendors often come to the military port to deliver vegetables, asking to see the captain, but when asked, they mean the ship service officer. One character difference but quite prestigious. If you meet a fat guy at the military port with eyes darting around like a businessman, don’t ask - nine times out of ten he’s the ship service officer. There are many jokes about ship service officers that I won’t go into here.</p><p>The military doctor - this is a prominent figure, sometimes with higher rank than the captain. They can treat minor illnesses well and can also handle major illnesses - this is everyone’s evaluation of them. The mechanical and electrical department is the key department on a warship. Whether a warship can move depends on their skills. Their power is beyond your imagination.</p><p>The mechanical and electrical officer whispers in the captain’s ear, and that’s it - limited fresh water use. One person gets only one small cup of fresh water per day, really not enough. Fresh water, diesel, engine oil, gasoline, electricity, air conditioning, and even the key to the refrigerated food storage - they have it all. Too unfair, but who let the refrigeration equipment be in the cold storage compartment? In summer, seeing the compartment sailors like magicians taking out ice cream to show off in front of everyone can really make people angry. They have the right to enter all compartments on the warship, and when the air conditioning is bad, sometimes you have to beg those oil guys. But to be fair, they are also the hardest working brothers. The unpleasant diesel smell in the engine room is not something ordinary people can tolerate. I generally don’t get seasick easily, but when I go down to the engine room and get hit by the oil smell - wow! Better go up and vomit, save yourself from being scolded by those oil guys. Believe it or not, vomiting is contagious. Hard as it is, these brothers invented a kind of food - putting potatoes, sweet potatoes, and such things next to the exhaust pipe, and they’re cooked in a while. When there’s good weather and the ship doesn’t sway much, the phone in the engine room control room rings constantly. Brothers from all departments are hungry - can you cook something to eat? As long as the mechanical and electrical officer turns a blind eye, they can satisfy everyone. Only the ship service officer is unhappy: “These potatoes and onions are reserved for tomorrow, these spendthrifts.” From this, everyone can imagine how high the temperature in the engine room is. Although machine operation can be completed in the control room, someone is usually left to watch the machines - to discover faults early. They also have a special skill - hand signals. Due to the loud noise, they can only gesture to each other. The gestures are self-made - there’s no unified regulation in the “Ship Regulations.”</p><h3 id="Taiwan-Strait-Military-Confrontation"><a href="#Taiwan-Strait-Military-Confrontation" class="headerlink" title="Taiwan Strait Military Confrontation"></a>Taiwan Strait Military Confrontation</h3><p>In the mid-1980s, our country announced to the world that the nautical charts of the Taiwan Strait and its surrounding waters had been completed, ending the long-term use of foreign-drawn charts. This declaration seemed ordinary on paper, but the bittersweet experiences were only truly understood by the officers and soldiers of our Eastern and Southern fleets who participated in the charting and provided escort.</p><p>To successfully complete the mission, all our hydrographic survey vessels were painted white. At that time, a strange white fleet appeared along the southeastern coast. It was precisely this large-scale fleet (the largest naval concentration since the founding of the nation) that greatly alarmed the Taiwanese authorities, who also dispatched all their combat vessels to engage in military confrontation with us in the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>This military confrontation lasted for half a year. During this period, there were constant frictions, both large and small, but ultimately neither side escalated into large-scale combat.</p><h3 id="Cat-and-Mouse-Game"><a href="#Cat-and-Mouse-Game" class="headerlink" title="Cat and Mouse Game"></a>Cat and Mouse Game</h3><p>One day in the 1980s, our observation and communication station discovered a rapidly moving fleet of unknown nationality near our territorial waters. That day happened to coincide with a strong storm at sea. Amid the sound of emergency departure bells, we set out. As soon as the warship left the harbor, everyone suffered terribly—spinning left, right, up, down, front, and back. Our nostrils and throats were filled with noodles, unable to spit them out or swallow them down (the navy has an unwritten rule: no noodles or fried breadsticks during sea voyages). However, everyone had prepared one of the three treasures—a paint can—hanging from their chests at their battle stations. As we approached the target, several warships changed formation and carefully approached. When we turned on the floodlights, haha, it turned out to be seven or eight patrol boats from the British Royal Navy’s Hong Kong fleet. It seemed they were also afraid of the big waves. We sent a series of signals, ordering them to leave our territorial waters, or else we wouldn’t be polite. A chubby head poked out from a porthole and gave an OK gesture. Several British vessels weighed anchor.</p><p>After circling around, they suddenly accelerated toward our mainland. “Ram them, drive them out!” After receiving the order, our three vessels charged straight over to block their path. Looking at their small hulls (the only time I felt proud), floating unsteadily in the swells, the captain was in a dilemma. If we rammed too hard, they would capsize and sink; if too lightly, they would still escape. We had greater tonnage, but they had greater numbers. As soon as we drove one away, another would rush in. The night passed like this. As dawn slowly broke, everyone was exhausted. Something new happened—two of their boats sent people to throw eggs and potatoes at us. Our ship service officer organized people to respond with onions. Another brother brought a vegetable basket, lined with blankets, specifically to catch their eggs. Of course, not a single intact egg was caught, and he himself became an egg product. This couldn’t go on forever. The deputy captain thought of a good solution: one of our brothers wore chemical protection gear inside and fire protection gear outside, enduring the clubs thrown by the other side, and tied a cable to their railing. Before they could cut it, we could drag them quite far.</p><p>At noon came good news: our side had dispatched ten escort boats to relieve us. Seeing they couldn’t gain any advantage, the other side sheepishly accelerated and ran away.</p><p>Results: We had three lightly wounded. Lost six baskets of onions. Minor scratches on the ship’s hull. Four bamboo poles. One kitchen knife. One cable. The other side had several lightly wounded. Potatoes and eggs unknown.</p><h3 id="Submarine-Tracking-Part-1"><a href="#Submarine-Tracking-Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Submarine Tracking (Part 1)"></a>Submarine Tracking (Part 1)</h3><p>The variety of submarine models from the former S country, I think everyone has heard about. They change models every three years and introduce new types every five years, making their old opponents confused and unable to figure them out. For a period, due to strategic needs, their old opponent actively sought our friendship. Both sides went back and forth, performing a wonderful love comedy. But lovers always have a day to part, and almost overnight, they changed their face, pulling up their pants and not recognizing anyone. This kind of manly behavior is really unacceptable!</p><p>　　Getting back to the point, during a certain year’s anchorage training, which was in full swing and reaching its end, the brothers were counting on their fingers every day, calculating that in a few more days they could return to base. When people stay at sea for too long, their eyes turn green, and if they hold on for two more days, something is bound to happen. They ran out of cigarettes a few days ago; there’s an island nearby with a tobacco field, which I knew about for years. One night, someone came up with a bad idea, and the captain sent four brothers in a lifeboat, saying they were going to the island to buy cigarettes; but in the pitch dark, where would there be cigarettes for sale? Everyone understood tacitly. Two hours passed, and the brothers who went to buy cigarettes on the island returned, not only failing to buy cigarettes but almost getting beaten up, losing one shoe while running, but fortunately they were wearing work clothes; otherwise, the trouble would have been much bigger. Early the next morning, a mission came. Four ships formed a formation to execute submarine search missions in a certain sea area hundreds of nautical miles away. This time it was intelligence from M country, saying that S country’s latest model submarine was conducting sea trials in this sea area, where the water depth, temperature, and seawater concentration were particularly suitable for such activities. Our mission was to test its speed and other technical indicators. Sounds easy, but finding a submarine in the vast sea is not an easy task. After a busy preparation, we headed straight to the sea area. Swaying all the way, we arrived on time. Ha, it was really lively here; there were anti-submarine aircraft from a certain country in the sky, and warships from a small country on the sea surface; M country’s face was indeed very big. A group of light signals came over, and the signal recruit struggled for a long time, checking the Morse code before translating: Welcome to join us! These F country little devils actually used such an uncommon language, as if intentionally making things difficult for our brothers. We lined up in submarine search formation, slowed down, and turned on the attack sonar. We plowed like an old ox, back and forth. I don’t know how long it took, but the aircraft in the sky also left; F country’s warships also lost heart, staying far away as if not working anymore. The sonar station reported discovering a large moving target, and neighboring ships also discovered it. Everyone immediately got excited, automatic tracking, it fast we fast, it slow we slow, turning left and right… Speed, depth and other indicators obtained, that was so satisfying! Shore command ordered return, telling F country’s little ones we’ll meet again, the signal soldier finished sending signals and revealed a mysterious smile. On the return journey, I asked that little soldier, and he mysteriously told me that the captain’s order was sent to the other side using international signals. He also sent a group of garbled code that even he couldn’t understand, ha, enough for the other side to check for years. I promised that little soldier to keep it secret for him; this was a serious violation of regulations. Everyone, don’t say I betrayed him today! Last year that young man from back then came to see me; talking about this incident he was still scared, you know if it was during war, he might have lost his life.</p><p>　　Several months later we learned that those few days S country’s submarine wasn’t conducting sea trials in that sea area at all, M country had fooled us. The underwater target might have been M country’s own submarine. It seems M country’s intelligence wasn’t as accurate as they boasted.</p><h3 id="Submarine-Tracking-Part-2"><a href="#Submarine-Tracking-Part-2" class="headerlink" title="Submarine Tracking (Part 2)"></a>Submarine Tracking (Part 2)</h3><p>Sorry everyone, I went on a long trip and couldn’t find a computer, really feel ashamed. To make a living, I’ll often go out fishing in the future, fish don’t wait for people, please forgive me. This fishing trip was quite fruitful, and I encountered something novel, I’ll tell you when I have the chance. This afternoon I returned home with nothing to do, and that dog didn’t recognize me, kicked it once and it became much more obedient. Lying in bed at night unable to sleep, recalling the years of running around at sea, it’s hard to accurately summarize in words, and the interesting stories are endless.</p><p>　　 I remember it was still one winter, two of our warships were on combat duty at a certain archipelago in the south, and when the duty period expired, on the way back to base we suddenly received orders to dock at a nearby island military port for resupply and standby. Thinking about entering the long-missed military port and familiar environment, and those beautiful uniformed sisters we hadn’t seen for over a year, the brothers’ hearts were blooming with joy. At noon we entered the port and docked, and I discovered that some brothers who usually loved wearing oily work clothes suddenly had neat military appearance, even the beards on their faces were shaved clean, these wool uniforms with polished leather shoes really looked handsome! “These few guys need special attention” the political commissar also started arranging work tasks. According to my experience, sudden tasks were coming, the guys’ handsomeness was in vain, they wouldn’t dare run around even if you gave them a dog’s courage, so we could rest assured. After fuel, fresh water, food and other supplies were completed, the following time became difficult for the brothers. Since the warship could depart at any time, the brothers didn’t dare go far, and those handsome guys also got themselves into trouble, changing back to oily work clothes. Many brothers who ran out of cigarettes started getting anxious, standing on the dock, not caring which unit they knew or didn’t know, seeing people they would kowtow and burn incense, collecting cigarette supplies. The dock duty sentry was puzzled, are these birds on the ship all lazy? He didn’t know that if they missed the dock they would have to eat and carry the consequences. There are always exceptions, those big smokers who couldn’t get cigarettes even by kowtowing and burning incense, their eyes focused on the broken bicycle used by the ship’s department for buying vegetables, they wanted to gamble. The military service center was quite far from the dock, but riding that thing back and forth for twenty minutes was enough. Several brothers gathered together extending their oily hands, hammer, scissors, paper, and the winner would grin showing big yellow teeth, Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! The laughter made people want to pee. After several rounds, the remaining guy became the unlucky one. He took advantage of the duty officer’s inattention, moved that broken bike onto the dock, and after getting on, he rushed to the service center like his life depended on it. Saying he was unlucky was not wrong at all, this guy had only left for a few minutes when the signal station’s light signals arrived. When the emergency departure deployment bell rang, the brothers near the dock ran aboard, nervously making departure preparations. The captain found one person missing and scolded that duty officer bloody. The duty officer was full of anger, found those accomplices, and made a poisonous vow: “If there’s a problem, everyone goes to the anchor chain compartment”. More than ten minutes later, the warship left the dock, and from afar we saw a bicycle rushing along the seawall road. The guy was really pitiful, sweating profusely but still couldn’t catch up. The captain used the loudspeaker to order the guy to return to base on his own. Thousands of miles, crossing mountains and seas, go beg your way back!</p><p>We sailed to a near-shore waterway, received notification from superiors that fishermen had recently discovered submarine periscopes here multiple times. Brother units had been working here all day, we came to replace them. We deployed in submarine search formation, turned on active and passive sonar, and several brothers even moved several boxes of grenades from the ammunition compartment. Everyone might not know, but submarine attacks are divided into “kill them dead” and “drive them away” two types. “Kill them dead” means using ship’s depth charges and anti-submarine torpedoes for attack; during peacetime, the driving method is mostly used, forcing the other side to surface to verify identity. The best method is to use grenades to warn the other side, they can hear the explosion but it won’t harm the submarine, not too light not too heavy, just right. Looking at those eggs, my hands started itching. Since joining the army, I’ve only thrown two grenades total, and one of them was a dud. Hehe, today I’m going to throw them to my heart’s content. There weren’t enough people for manual bombing, so I and the military doctor came to the aft deck first. Those “depth charge” brothers temporarily taught the bombing essentials and the difference between “small series” and “large series”, then it was up to the sonar department’s skills. An hour passed, and these clean gentlemen actually didn’t discover even a hair, usually they were so boastful but now they started sweating and their limbs went cold. This made the brothers hold the eggs in proper posture but have no chance to throw them, wasting the brothers’ camera-ready poses. The leader was wise, this waterway wasn’t too deep, if there was a submarine it should be on the main channel, and it wouldn’t dare sail too fast, so why not go straight along the main channel. The opportunity came, the captain ordered dropping a “small series” every fifty seconds, and we saw the brothers throwing with beautiful posture while shouting exaggeratedly: “Small–Series”, the scene was very comical and funny. The sound of grenades exploding in water was more like someone sitting on a water tank farting “Dong, Dong” which was very familiar to the ears. The brothers got carried away, in the confusion some forgot to pull the safety pin, fortunately no one noticed, just treating it as a dud. I don’t know how long it took, but the eggs were all thrown, and the brothers were all tired, sitting on the aft deck panting. I suddenly had a strange thought, really wanted to throw a real one down…</p><p>　　 Shore command called, ordering to anchor in place to monitor underwater and surface conditions. After anchoring for three days, we received return orders, and on the return journey the brothers discussed, how reliable was this intelligence? I think, for such matters, it’s better to believe they exist than not, at worst it’s just conducting a practical submarine search exercise. On the third day back at base, that unlucky guy also arrived, still in that oily shiny broken work clothes, much thinner, his nightmare was about to begin from today… But this guy was quite honest, thousands of miles, the cigarettes he bought for the brothers weren’t missing a single pack.</p><h3 id="Getting-the-Diving-Bug"><a href="#Getting-the-Diving-Bug" class="headerlink" title="Getting the Diving Bug"></a>Getting the Diving Bug</h3><p>The day before yesterday a brother was going to Hebei to sell fish. I entrusted him to bring some seafood to my diving teacher’s family who had sacrificed; just hadn’t been in contact for a long time, didn’t know if the address had changed. Should have found it by today.</p><p>　　 Surface ships originally don’t need diving operations, but at sea we often encounter unexpected situations. One day, I was on leave returning to base, encountered warships at sea not yet returned, so I stayed at the guesthouse. A rare opportunity for self-management. The guesthouse was in a scenic area, with people coming and going, quite lively. Every day with nothing to do I would sit stupidly on the balcony, appreciating the beautiful MM passing by. Gradually I discovered that in this poor and simple place, there were actually people with the same interests as me. The person next door was even more professional, holding a single-tube high-power telescope, constantly adjusting focus on a grove of trees. I didn’t understand, what could be good to see in that grove. Eating in the cafeteria at the same table, I chatted with that person for a few sentences. He was a diver from a certain diving unit, a volunteer soldier, hometown in a certain county in Hebei, Manchu ethnicity, his ancestors had produced a seventh-rank county magistrate. This time he was ordered to come to our base to train a batch of divers, but since all warships were at sea, he stayed here for a while. I became friends with him through interaction. Diving had great attraction for me, thinking about diving underwater, being the same as sea creatures, and bringing one or two tools, the harvest would definitely be substantial. Dear readers, I only had this level of consciousness, in today’s terms it’s called using public resources for private gain. He took a tape measure and measured my face. Does diving require good looks? I was born with a strange appearance, just say it straight. He explained for a while, as if saying my face was too long, wearing a diving mask would easily leak. Nonsense. According to his requirements, I didn’t meet a single condition. However, he agreed…</p><p>When the warship returned to port from sea, the notice came down. Each ship selected three people to concentrate in the training room, and sure enough my name was on that list. Diving is divided into light diving and heavy diving, theoretically with forty meters as the boundary. Light diving is the most common, and what we were going to learn this time; heavy diving isn’t something everyone gets the chance to do, the requirements are no lower than pilots. After theory classes were done, everyone couldn’t wait to get in the water. No way, exams were absolutely necessary. Nine theory courses total, if you fail one you’re eliminated. Poor me, old and myopic, I failed two courses…! Ah, let’s not mention it. The leader saw my revolutionary enthusiasm was high, so gave me another chance. Thank heaven and earth, the make-up exam was exactly eighty points, not too much not too little.</p><p>　　 We went to sea on a landing craft. According to regulations, we could only operate in places without underwater obstacles. Under my leadership and encouragement, the craft captain looked at the vegetable basket, swallowed some saliva, and squeezed out a few words from between his teeth: “Find coral reefs”. Ha. This is what you call revolutionary good brothers! Another brother saw the time was ripe, so spread out the tools he had secretly brought aboard on the deck. This captain who had never been to the open sea was dazzled. The fish and shrimp were going to have bad luck this time.</p><p>　　 We found a hidden reef, just at slack tide, water depth over ten meters, good underwater visibility. Three people per group: one person dives, one person pulls the signal rope, one person prepares for rescue. I was the oldest, naturally first to go. Put on equipment, tied lead weights around the waist, carried diving knife and other small things, a beautiful backward dive. Approaching the reef, there were indeed many sea creatures, staring at each other, I hardened my heart, to hell with it, just pick the big ones. Don’t touch sea urchins easily, my palm still hurts faintly. The mask was leaking water, the teacher had already taught a high technique, tilting the head and drinking it into the stomach, no problem at all.</p><p>　　 Come up. Change people. In less than two hours, several bottles of compressed air were used up, oxygen is expensive, can’t bear to waste. We docked at a nearby small island. The brothers at the oil depot on the island were really envious, they had never seen such high-end goods. The teacher was also generous, picked a few items and threw them over, enough for them to eat two meals. “Move these air tanks too, pump the pressure to 40, behave well and there will be more tomorrow”. Haha! Seems there really is no free lunch.</p><p>　　 Evening debriefing. The teacher put on a serious face, greatly praising how good theory combined with practice was! This fishing and catching shrimp perfectly matched various diving scenarios! Hearing this made me and the brothers’ hearts bloom with joy. The craft captain was worried, this meal couldn’t be finished, and there was no ice storage. Simply, give it all to the oil depot, their food standard was too low.</p><p>　　 For several days like this, the brothers played diving to their heart’s content. Time for the practical exam. But what the hell were they testing? The brothers were better at fin kicks than the teacher. That craft captain wasn’t a good guy, came up with a bad idea, letting the brothers scrape the tail shaft and propeller underwater for him. After scraping, everyone got good grades, all were happy.</p><p>　　 Over several months, the teacher and brothers’ feelings deepened, nothing was off-limits in conversation. When parting, everyone hugged and cried together.</p><p>　　 Two months later, bad news came that he was executing a special mission, diving alone, and died gloriously.</p><h3 id="Life’s-Wild-Fun"><a href="#Life’s-Wild-Fun" class="headerlink" title="Life’s Wild Fun"></a>Life’s Wild Fun</h3><p>Life at sea is very boring. Endless training, endless going to sea, missions one after another. This is how it is in peacetime, wartime might be even worse. But in the boredom, brothers can also find fun; lying on bed boards at night, women are truly the eternal topic; brothers you say one thing I say another, just talking without action but still finding their own joy; however, there are also brave ones. I remember there was a little brother from Hunan, who spoke very much like Chairman Mao. This guy had some strange habits for a while; every time he returned from sea he would get a high fever, the military doctor tried everything but couldn’t cure it. With a referral letter he was hospitalized. After several times, everyone inevitably became suspicious; sure enough, after the health worker’s strict investigation, it was discovered that this brother had an unusual relationship with a female nursing soldier in the hospital; everyone is generally very interested in such matters; every time the health worker returned victorious from investigation, the brothers would pester him, asking him to “start from the beginning, tell from the most minute details”. Those days, this health worker’s living standard was higher than the captain and political commissar, so high that even toothpaste was squeezed for him; sometimes the gap between people really is this big. Time to close the net. The captain, political commissar and military doctor discussed, the self-criticism and punishment couldn’t be avoided. Front deck assembly, military meeting for self-examination; the first time didn’t pass, and he also made all kinds of excuses. After deceiving the leaders and deceiving the party, he piled a bunch of stinky shit and urine on his own head, and got a tight curse of “retained on ship for observation” on his head. Privately everyone didn’t spare him from teasing, most brothers were quite envious of him, just suffering from not having the opportunity themselves. Since that incident, I discovered that the brothers had another hobby, loving to apply cosmetics to their faces. Haha! These brothers!</p><p>A warship’s crew comes from all over the country, and many people have special skills. For a while, playing guitar was popular on all naval ships; those who could play taught those who couldn’t, those who couldn’t taught those who couldn’t even more; in no time, everyone became experts; enriching cultural life, the leaders were very supportive; just that the guitar became a big problem for storage when going to sea. Not afraid of everyone laughing, last year I resumed my old profession at a friend’s place, and could still attract many MM listeners, making my heart itch; returning home I got a scolding from her: “Look at your behavior back then, you must not have been a good person when you were young”. When people get old, the strings seem to be tuned more accurately.</p><p>　　 Going to sea for training, it’s best to anchor near uninhabited islands at night; after dinner, find a reasonable excuse, take the lifeboat, five or six brothers go to the island; wait until it’s completely dark, first pile up two sand walls on the beach, take off pants, tie the pant legs; then open flashlights together, and you’ll see, the whole beach is full of fat and big crabs with nowhere to escape. At this time you can’t be soft-hearted, step on them and grab them, in no time you’ll fill a pair of pants. Back on the ship, the military doctor and health worker had already prepared medicine for the brothers, first bandage the wounds from crab pinches, then settle the crabs properly. At this time the ship leaders generally stay in their cabins and don’t come out, pretending to know nothing. Under the military doctor’s command, the brothers pick out the poisonous inedible crabs and throw them away, the rest are given to the military doctor, he’s an expert at cooking crabs. Now you look, the brothers all have their eating utensils ready, overjoyed and drooling. When the kitchen goes quiet, eating time is not far. Don’t rush, at this time the ship’s officer will appear on time, with an unhappy face: “I’ve told you many times, no random cooking in the kitchen”. First grab a few big ones and stuff them to him, he’s also in a difficult position! I’ve done this kind of thing many times, can’t remember how many. What’s strange to me is that every time the next morning, the clerk would take out a package wrapped in newspaper containing crab remains from the captain and political commissar’s cabins.</p><h3 id="South-China-Sea-Patrol"><a href="#South-China-Sea-Patrol" class="headerlink" title="South China Sea Patrol"></a>South China Sea Patrol</h3><p>One year, a southern country, out of ambition for our South China Sea islands, in their country’s latest published map; for the first time included our South China Sea islands in their territory. This was the first time in that country’s history. To demonstrate their so-called sovereignty, there would definitely be further actions. Sure enough, not long after, the island garrison troops frequently discovered those little ones driving various broken ships and boats appearing around our archipelago. During this time, they once even wanted to land on an uninhabited island. This was unacceptable, without superiors needing to mobilize, the brothers consciously maintained their weapons and equipment in optimal condition. Not easy! Although the brothers usually have various problems, at critical moments no one had diarrhea. The foreign ministry spokesperson routinely sent notes and protests again and again. What use is that, if protests were useful we would have liberated M country long ago, the brothers’ ears were calloused from hearing it. Those days, the dock was like today’s commodity fair, big trucks one after another. Really eye-opening; various emergency kits, latest leak-stopping equipment, latest helmets, latest chemical protection suits; even the most common canned food was the latest type, these logistics guys, what were they doing before? The brothers executed countless missions, this was the first time seeing such a setup; looks like this time they were going to play for real. If we’re going to play, play thoroughly, ship military doctors and health workers took hair clippers, looking at everyone with dissatisfaction, pushing and pulling, shouting and calling. Finally, a bald formation was born. “Political commissar leads, not a single hair left” this famous saying on warships was passed down from that time. All bald, but the brothers still weren’t satisfied, took out razors, up and down, left and right, mischievously gave themselves a self-skin preparation. Haha! This is what you call not a single hair left. A brother asked me to do the same, I didn’t dare, I was worried that if that place didn’t grow back it would be terrible; there are many green dragons, but where do you find white tigers! Give the brother some face, so I just shaved off my eyebrows.</p><p>We circled around the archipelago waters for several days, not even seeing a shadow of the foreign navy. The brothers were getting anxious, seeing that fresh water and food were running low, wasn’t this all for nothing? A telegram changed from patrol to temporary stationing. That place doesn’t require temporary residence permits, and you don’t need to worry about police catching you. Docking at the main island for resupply, the brothers’ eyes went straight; a group of sun-tanned female soldiers came aboard for a visit; really beautiful! An oily brother almost added fresh water to the diesel tank. The female soldiers came from the island hospital, this was the smallest but most advanced naval hospital I’ve seen. The female soldiers were very interested in everything on the warship, running around all cabins, asking questions while walking. Opportunity came, the brothers rushed to be guides; I was really puzzled, those brothers who usually spoke full of hometown dialect, all suddenly became standard Mandarin speakers, and with coquettish voices. I wanted to take two brothers to walk around the island, but no one gave face, these guys, really value beauty over friendship. In the afternoon things happened, the hospital was crowded with ship crew coming to see the doctor. Sick, not sick, really sick, fake sick, almost as if they had agreed, they gave the ship’s military doctor a beating, and especially requested injections. The political commissar and military doctor wouldn’t have it: “All go back to the ship for medical treatment, don’t embarrass yourselves here”. These brothers’ few tricks, how could they be the political commissar’s match, he’s a professional at this game.</p><p>　　 Superior notification, a foreign reconnaissance ship would arrive in our sea area around midnight. The little ones really dared to come, the brothers were extremely excited, instantly forgetting all about the hospital mm, really good guys, I still admire them today! The boarding team was fully armed and temporarily practiced. At midnight, radar really discovered the target. Seems our intelligence was much more accurate than M country’s. Battle alert, full speed to engage the enemy, turn on strong lights, pull alongside. It really was the foreign ship, several guys dressed as fishermen were jabbering who knows what. “Boarding team board” the captain gave the order, I led seven or eight brothers and landed accurately on their deck. The brothers hadn’t even steadied themselves when they held submachine guns horizontally, shouting “Song Ye Dong Mo” and rushed straight to their bridge and radio room; these little ones were scared silly, many people but not one dared to resist, it took less than two minutes, fired a burst into the sky, and the brothers completely controlled this disguised fishing boat of about two hundred tons, the little ones also obediently lay face down on the deck. After searching, more than ten submachine guns, two 40mm rocket launchers, and a large amount of S country-made electronic reconnaissance equipment were found on the ship, even our ship’s communications officer said it was advanced; this guy, diminishing our own prestige, boosting others’ morale. Handcuff the little ones, throw them into the anchor chain compartment. Return. Hehe, I got to experience being captain early, just that the speed of that broken ship was really too slow. I’m not talented, when docking at port I dented the bow of that broken ship. I still regret it now, this was my only poor record of docking.</p><p>　　 On the third day, the foreign foreign ministry made a strong protest to us, saying we captured several of their fishermen in their territorial waters. The brothers didn’t like hearing such nonsense, single-mindedly running to the hospital regardless, the political commissar’s scolding was completely forgotten!</p><p>Due to life’s pressure, I had to go to sea to fish. The past two days I was busy mending nets, didn’t continue the story, really feel ashamed. Today with nothing to do, and after drinking two cups of cat urine, I hazily remembered those brothers…</p><p>　　 After temporarily staying on the island for several months, I gradually became familiar with this archipelago. Not far away there was a small island, where spring water would sometimes gush out; passing fishing boats would also make brief stops on the island. One day, the brothers had been tossing and turning for dozens of hours, stinking all over; the brothers were too miserable, staying too long in the South China Sea’s hot and humid environment, the precious eggs between their legs all rotted, the yolk almost flowing out, itchy and painful. It had rained a few days ago, maybe there would be spring water on the island. Under the military doctor’s strong request, the superiors agreed to land on the island to clean personal hygiene, but not to pollute the spring source. The warship anchored five or six hundred meters from the island, lowered the small boat, arranged the order according to how ugly the walking posture was, and went ashore in batches. I had experienced this taste many times in previous years, incurable. But natural mineral water had unexpected curative effects on it, after two or three times you could escape the danger of being childless. The spring water was limited, so the military doctor came up with a brilliant idea; let each brother take a small container, fill it with spring water, hold it steady with one hand, then put that big cannon with ammunition inside. You look, the deck was full of brothers in such postures. The brothers were so comfortable, their eyes comfortable into slits, and they were still talking nonsense. Don’t provoke them now, they really will get angry with you. Neighboring ships sent signals asking: Is your ship’s toilet broken? Do you need help repairing it.</p><p>　　 People who often go to sea know that wind and waves aren’t really scary, swells are the ship’s natural enemy. The brothers finally endured the hot summer, time to return to base. The brothers who had become familiar with that group of black mm at the hospital over these months were dumbfounded. As the saying goes: able to pick up, able to put down. Unexpectedly these brothers hadn’t picked up anything yet, but couldn’t put down like this, really embarrassing. On the day of departure, I had prepared early and took out binoculars, discovering two or three black mm with eyes crying like peaches in the coconut grove by the dock, gazing affectionately at the warship about to depart.</p><p>　　 On the return journey we encountered big swells, and before half the journey we got another mission. Cooperating with a submarine unit for training. Said it was training, but actually just being targets for them, if a training torpedo passes under the ship, you lose. This kind of work, no one wants to do it, it’s unlucky! But when you’re assigned, you have to do it well. After training was completed that day, the brothers followed the submarine to a new environment, a bigger island. At that time a Hong Kong martial arts TV series was popular, as long as there were no missions, we watched it every day, obsessed. That day after training ended, after dinner, the brothers set up the TV on the dock, just waiting for Zhao Zhongxiang to shut up.</p><p>　　 But right at this time, notification came for a meeting. The brothers patiently listened to the big, medium, and small leaders’ endless, fragrant and long reports and summaries; finally, this big leader stood up: “Let me add three more points…”. When we turned on the TV, the yellow flower vegetables were cold.</p><p>　　 On days when we don’t go to sea, after finishing routine work, the brothers can have free activities. Said it’s free, but buying a pack of cigarettes requires walking two hours round trip. The dock was too noisy, submarine engines roaring, as if never finishing charging. A brother discovered a good place, behind the military port mountain there was a reef, after low tide the sea creatures parasitic on the reef were exposed. The political commissar was from Zhejiang, naturally had good feelings for such sea creatures. Just that on the way we had to pass a sentry post, said that place was unsafe, prohibiting all animals from entering. Maybe there was room for negotiation; the political commissar took several brothers, put rust scrapers and fishing gear in pockets, and took two cans of fruit. The military police company’s little sentry was quite good at handling things, calling “Chief Chief Chief” repeatedly, making the brothers’ hearts bloom with joy, two cans handed over, he wasn’t polite either, wolfed them down in no time. There’s hope, the sugar-coated bullets were indeed powerful. Who knew that after eating, this guy wiped his mouth, rolled his eyes, and still the same. The brothers were really angry, wanted to use force, the political commissar was afraid of causing trouble, so took everyone back. “We’ll settle accounts with you later” left a harsh word when leaving. I concluded from this: sentries are generally black everywhere, you can only treat them like in movies. Angry, on the return journey we happened to meet the brother who discovered that reef. He hehe laughed, took everyone into a cave warehouse. Left turn right turn, like guerrillas in tunnel warfare, soon emerged from a cave entrance. This was the cave warehouse generator’s exhaust vent. This guy, born to be a thief, he could find such side paths too. Spread out the tools, some knocking and hitting, fishing was my strong point. Sun setting, returned with full load. Walk from the main road, anger that traitorous sentry; not far, this perfectly good road suddenly disappeared, high tide water flooded the main road, the other side of the road was a cliff. The tide flow around reefs is complex, generally with undercurrents. The brothers drew in a cold breath. How dangerous! If we couldn’t return at night, this would really be a big problem.</p><p>Back on the ship, as usual we ate a big meal. Just that the chicken claw snail, I found really terrifying, didn’t dare touch it.</p><h3 id="Foreign-Aid"><a href="#Foreign-Aid" class="headerlink" title="Foreign Aid"></a>Foreign Aid</h3><p>The warships our country built in previous years, comprehensive performance was a bit worse than developed countries. But individual performance indicators weren’t bad at all, we also have advantages others can’t compare to, they’re too cheap. With the same amount of silver, you might only be able to buy a luxury yacht in developed countries, and it would have to be second-hand. But here, you can buy a fully equipped, truly meaningful, cannon-firing warship.</p><p>　　 This day, after finishing routine work, the brothers came to rest at the shore pavilion. The sun made the deck hot, the temperature in the compartments below deck was even over fifty degrees, nowhere to hide. Sitting on the stone bench in the pavilion, with a breeze blowing, spread out the battlefield, ordered division commanders and army commanders to stand in position, everyone making noise, killing until dark. The one about to win, with a cigarette butt in his mouth, showing big yellow teeth, still not giving up; the brother about to lose, face turning blue, sweating from anger, wanting to kick everyone. This guy, ice cream was definitely bought, everyone gets a share. Ha, who told him to be so stingy usually, not earning sympathy! “I–Love–You, ice cream selling little old man ah head ah head ah head…” the big yellow teeth started singing. Taking advantage when in power, not a good thing either!</p><p>　　 In the afternoon we received orders. The brothers were to go to sea alone, to a “relatively big” city to execute foreign affairs missions. Oil, non-staple food were resupplied according to long-distance voyage standards. After sailing for more than ten hours, the brothers were exhausted. At night the warship sailed into a shipyard. The worker brothers dismantled the conference room’s tables, chairs, and benches that night, installed leather sofas, actually leaving no trace of dismantling and installation. This factory, if they had such ass-kissing skills in shipbuilding, they wouldn’t have… Reform and opening up, but this kind of novelty was encountered for the first time.</p><p>　　 The brothers had extremely rich imaginations, after arguing and guessing, unanimously believed it might be to send a visiting foreign head of state back to his country. I secretly drank several small cups of wine that day, hazily sitting on the soft leather sofa, actually thinking that foreign head of state must have hemorrhoids all over his ass, otherwise there’s no reason to make the sofa so soft. In this hot weather he doesn’t take a plane, wants to play heart-pounding games? Must be a pervert. Just that it would be hard on these brothers, hot weather, not moving and already sweating. As usual, full ship cleaning, polishing brass, touch-up painting; brothers also busy getting haircuts, polishing shoes, spotless. Three days later, the warship came to a dock. Hoisted full dress flags, brothers in neat uniforms stood on the right deck. In the time it takes to take a shit, a motorcade came, with much fanfare a group of dark-skinned foreign military personnel got out. Led by our accompanying personnel to the dock, performed grand ceremony, boarded the ship and walked three circles, then came to the conference room. The leader was a half-black fat officer, sitting on that sofa fidgeting left and right. Ha, really has hemorrhoids, I secretly laughed. A brother from the base who “doesn’t pay money even when eating in city restaurants” secretly told me, these guys were members of a certain Southeast Asian country’s head of state’s visiting delegation to China, that “hemorrhoid” was that country’s navy minister, wanting to order multiple ships of our same model, the brothers’ mission this time was just to carry them and fully demonstrate this type of ship’s performance at sea, so that “hemorrhoid” would finally decide and sign. A good deal, the brothers certainly couldn’t refuse.<br>Light fires and set sail. The brothers changed into work clothes, each in position, each doing their duty. Those black attendants also couldn’t stay idle, running around all cabins randomly. You know, they were all experts, but the political commissar was quick-witted, passed down orders that these critical compartments were closed to visitors. The warship came to international waters, high-speed sailing, high-speed turning, high-speed reversing, fully demonstrating the maneuverability to the limit. The engineering officer later touched the machines, sighing and shedding tears, he really felt heartbroken. Anti-surface attack, anti-air attack, anti-submarine attack. The brothers acted for real, practicing to perfection. You could see that “hemorrhoid” was very satisfied, with mutual flattery. Back at port in the evening, “hemorrhoid” proposed to host all officers. ** scar, the brothers were hungry all day, a few people benefited, too unfair.</p><p>　　 The second year, that country sent a large number of ship-receiving personnel, led by a navy lieutenant commander. I was fortunate to join the so-called foreign aid team, teaching these foreign gentlemen hand in hand. During this time, I was extremely strict with them, they would only ever say one Chinese sentence: “Yes, sir.” Even if you cursed at them, you often got the same answer, really couldn’t get a fart out with three sticks. Made me so angry. Don’t know why, every time I saw that leading lieutenant commander, I immediately thought of that fat black guy’s “hemorrhoids”, so that excretion port below became burning hot, endlessly!</p><h3 id="Gulf-of-Tonkin-Storm"><a href="#Gulf-of-Tonkin-Storm" class="headerlink" title="Gulf of Tonkin Storm"></a>Gulf of Tonkin Storm</h3><p>Every summer, warm and cold air currents often converge over the South Pacific, quickly forming typhoons. Every year when this season arrives, the local area and military meteorological departments monitor around the clock to prevent disasters. Animals often show too much helplessness and passivity in the face of nature. I remember one year when I went to a certain place, I happened to encounter a typhoon. All the ships, large and small, sailed upstream along a river to take shelter. On a hillside by the river, I was surprised to discover a several-thousand-ton Singaporean passenger ship lying flat there. This was the masterpiece of the 1969 typhoon that made landfall. That time it also caused a major breach in the Liutianyang seawall, and sadly, a regiment of brothers from an army farm inside Liutianyang, many of whom couldn’t swim, asked the local navy for help, but all the navy ships had gone to distant anchorages to avoid the storm… These two brother units have not interacted with each other since then. The navy was also wronged—it was all the typhoon’s fault!</p><p>In our South China Sea, there is a famous large bay—the Gulf of Tonkin. In recent years, our country has conducted boundary demarcation negotiations with neighboring countries, achieving good results. But these negotiations were limited to land boundaries. On the vast sea, these boundaries are not so easy to divide. In the middle of the Gulf of Tonkin, there is a small island with legendary status. It’s called legendary because before the 1970s, this island was always under our country’s jurisdiction, but later, somehow, it became one of the “disputed” areas with a certain country. According to that country’s people, their “Grandpa Fox” had once courted French girls on this island during the anti-M period. Don’t believe it? There’s a poem presented by your country’s highest leader at the time as evidence, and the island mentioned in that poem is this one. I haven’t seen that poem, but I always feel this isn’t much of a fox’s reason! Although the island isn’t large, its strategic position is extraordinary—it’s an important gateway controlling the sea exit of our Guangxi region. Sure enough, when the two countries became hostile, that country threw itself into the embrace of a certain northern superpower. Finally, one day, intelligence showed that country was preparing to carry out a “project” on that island. Given that country’s technological level and financial resources, undertaking such a project was unlikely—someone behind the scenes was providing technology and money. Once this “project” was completed, it would pose a huge threat to our southern fleet. Based on my understanding of the navy, this grievance absolutely had to be avenged.</p><p>Soon, all units received notifications to have each ship report faults, and arrange repairs according to the severity of the faults. When everything was ready, the order was issued. It was said that a large-scale military exercise would be held, codenamed “Wolf Character No Number.” That lineup was enough to make that country, which called itself the “First Military Power in South Asia,” tremble with fear. The brothers knew what was up, and their preparations took on an extra layer of tension and enthusiasm. Blood type verification, distribution of various materials, political mobilization, all kinds of petitions for battle—the brothers used various tricks to express their patriotic enthusiasm. I’ve never been one to fall behind in such matters, so I quietly handed the political commissar a party membership application. Hehe, seems a bit opportunistic, laughable! I remember there was also a little brother from Guangxi who found the military doctor, insisting on contributing his family’s ancestral secret recipe for stopping bleeding. Never mind the effectiveness of the recipe, just his serious attitude moved me deeply. To confirm the brothers’ suspicions, I called a brother in the Marine Corps. He was also doing pre-battle training, with the focus on beach assault landings. It seemed everything was as the brothers had guessed. So, all the brothers left letters and items for their families, and I also wrote my first will in my life. We set sail at night, rushing to the assembly anchorage. When leaving port, the mountaintop signal station sent an unusual series of light signals… We accelerated out of port, needing to cover several hundred nautical miles in twenty hours—the brothers didn’t dare be careless. But during the voyage, we received bad news: a typhoon would hit the assembly area, and our six ships were assigned to the second echelon, ordered to wait nearby. The command ship sent a signal: enter a certain island, anchor in port and wait for orders. The brothers were so angry, cursing everything male and female, even the heavenly kings. This damn second echelon was actually just a reserve force, no different from a mobile collection station. Poor this battle-hardened unit, actually reduced to the same fate as during the Xisha naval battle.</p><p>One day later. That unwelcome typhoon actually made a feint in the predetermined assembly area, then turned left, heading straight for that country’s northeast coast. That country was caught off guard, and wherever the typhoon went, people and horses were overturned. Of course, our Guangxi coast was also a disaster area, also caught off guard. A local “first” formation suffered heavy losses, with several warships washed up on the beach and stranded, needing to wait for “high tide” before they could be towed into deep water. I secretly calculated that such “high tide” doesn’t come every day—they’d have to wait at least until next month, probably missing this wave. Naturally, the brothers received orders to head straight for Guangxi. Ha! The “second” had also become the “first.” Really satisfying!</p><p>During that period, our country’s diplomatic performance was very good, maintaining silence throughout. Unlike the later large exercise in a certain strait, which was loudly publicized and earth-shattering, but backfired. You know, things that really want to bite you never make noise. That country also learned of our country’s determination through its master, and another “recovery of Xisha” was completely possible. So, that “project” had no further developments, remaining so to this day. This is the origin of the Chinese version of the “Cuban Missile Crisis.” Achieving strategic objectives through a large-scale military exercise—this was the only time in our navy’s history. The “Wolf Character No Number” exercise was destined to be recorded in naval history. No wonder that when the exercise was nearing its end, the highest leader at the time personally visited the exercise site to review the participating troops. I also received my first pair of snow-white navy pants that hadn’t been issued yet. As for that opportunistic matter, it was soon fulfilled as wished. Hehe! Laughable!</p><p>“Subduing the enemy without fighting”—truly wonderful beyond words!</p><h3 id="About-the-“Military-Doctor”"><a href="#About-the-“Military-Doctor”" class="headerlink" title="About the “Military Doctor”"></a>About the “Military Doctor”</h3><p>When I was young, I was weak and sickly, barely attended elementary school, and could only recognize a few Chinese characters. When I was a child, it often rained, and getting soaked like a drowned chicken while playing was common. After being beaten by my father, I probably damaged my vitality, and even at a young age I would be bedridden with illness. Fortunately, there was a military hospital near my hometown, so I became a regular there. Because I was as thin as an animal resembling a human, the doctors and nurses there called me “Monkey.” One beautiful female nurse mysteriously told me one day that she had changed my hospital records to show me as a soldier from a certain unit, so I could avoid paying a large sum when discharged. “Monkey” was young and ignorant, not knowing what benefits this would bring, just thinking that the People’s Liberation Army auntie really liked monkeys…</p><p>When I grew up and joined the military, I learned that being a military doctor on a warship is not easy. Besides treating patients, he also has to distinguish whether you have a real illness or a fake one based on special circumstances. Facing familiar brothers all day, some things are really hard to be straightforward about. Fortunately, the military doctor on my ship was a big joker, and such matters didn’t seem to trouble him.</p><p>The ship’s military doctor was surnamed Wang, from Beijing, with the second-highest rank on the ship, so he also had the nickname “Wang Number Two.” This person was extremely improper, always acting crazy and running around to various compartments chatting when he had nothing to do, but he was still popular with the brothers. I sometimes even worried he would corrupt these brothers—he truly deserved the nickname “Old Improper.” Don’t look at his mouth being improper, but his medical skills were excellent, especially treating liver disease, which was his specialty, and he was quite famous in the garrison. But according to him, what he was most proficient in was actually gynecology. After hearing this, the brothers all bulged their eyes, with “Admirable! Admirable!” praises ringing out…</p><p>Every time we returned from sea or entered the factory for ship repairs, a small number of brothers would go to “Wang Number Two” for medical treatment, regardless of whether it was a serious or minor illness, all demanding hospitalization. Some brothers just wanted something new—they would try every means to go to places they hadn’t been to, plus brothers who had been hospitalized would add fuel to the fire with their wild stories, describing a perfectly good hospital as a mess. If you went to the hospital and didn’t encounter anything “special,” the brothers would absolutely look down on you, even despise you, saying you were a “sand nose egg” who wasted time in the hospital. So, brothers who returned victorious from the hospital after recovering from serious illness, to avoid being that “sand nose egg,” would tell other brothers all about their romantic encounters after returning to the ship, and sighing, would call themselves “experienced people.” In those days, every evening after dinner was the fixed storytelling time for “experienced people,” with brothers gathered in circles listening with wild imaginations and great attention. The captain said: “Why do you guys always doze off during meetings?” The final results of these romantic encounters were surprisingly similar: at parting, those nurse girls would cry like tearful people, seeing them off again and again, unable to drive them away…</p><p>Most brothers on the ship were young men around twenty years old. After hearing such descriptions from those “experienced people,” you can imagine the position the hospital held in the brothers’ hearts. Brothers with illnesses generally first went through the ship’s military doctor or base clinic for treatment. If they encountered serious illness, they needed the ship’s or clinic’s military doctor to issue a “referral letter” to send them to a better-equipped large hospital. This large hospital had detailed departments, treating all diseases, with many retired “old military doctors” providing consultations. But what the brothers valued most was that they could be hospitalized here and have zero-distance contact with nurse girls…</p><p>One year during factory repairs, before the ship announced the specific time to enter the factory, brothers with good connections couldn’t sit still. After running around at sea for over a year, they finally had a chance to “get seriously ill.” One brother seemed to have learned some special skill, actually reaching the highest level where he could get sick just by saying he was sick, and it was serious illness requiring hospitalization… Really pitiful, a young man lying in bed for several days, not eating for several days, speaking in a voice as small as a mosquito’s, moaning constantly at night—anyone who saw him would feel heartbroken and shed tears. The military doctor examined him several times but couldn’t cure him with medicine. The old guy’s eyes rolled, he waved his pen, and issued a hospitalization referral letter, not forgetting to add when parting: “You must find an ‘old military doctor’ for this illness, they guarantee treatment.” That kid went to the hospital happily for examination, and sure enough it was a “difficult and complicated case,” first hospitalized for observation for several days, with injections and medicine provided.</p><p>What kind of person is a military doctor? His small eyes rolling would definitely make brothers nervous. Tricks like tampering with thermometers and other childish methods could no longer fool him into issuing “referral letters.” This move was indeed high-level, the first time I’d seen it. I admired it, but not eating for several days was really something ordinary brothers didn’t dare imitate. The cunning military doctor, bringing the health worker, came to that brother’s bedside and searched inside and out, actually finding many empty food bags…</p><p>The truth came out. The military doctor made a phone call to the hospital—what he said is unknown. The next day, a doctor from the hospital came to talk to that kid, saying he had a serious illness requiring immediate surgery, asking him to be mentally prepared…</p><p>The large hospital was indeed powerful, using high-grade medicine—really a miracle. On the third day, that kid returned to the ship to report, claiming the medicine had cured him, his illness was completely healed, and he really looked as lively as before. I couldn’t figure it out. According to him, he returned to catch up with physical labor like unloading shells, afraid the department was short-handed. What a good comrade, thinking about work even while sick, really should be commended. The military doctor was even more caring and loving toward the patient, trying every means to persuade him to return to the hospital for a few more days of observation, but that kid absolutely refused to go back… In the evening, the hospital called, extremely dissatisfied, basically saying that kid had sneaked out of the hospital and asking him to return to the hospital to complete discharge procedures… Really no organization, no discipline.</p><p>The military doctor isn’t completely rigid either, after all, he’s one of the brothers. If you really are sick, he will personally escort brothers to the hospital for treatment. Every year, several months before older brothers are discharged, he would have a fit of madness, asking each veteran: “Take out your bird and let me look at it.” The veterans were shocked, protecting their birds tightly with both hands, afraid they would fly away. This bird military doctor was really unpredictable. The result of his examining “that bird” was sending several brothers with overly long bird skin to the hospital for circumcision surgery, saying people would thank him in a few years—really talking nonsense. Only when about to leave the unit did he give brothers this hospitalization opportunity—really hate this “Wang Number Two.” After brothers finished their bird skin surgery and returned to the ship from the hospital, bold “sand nose eggs” would go to complain to those “experienced people”: “You almost got me slapped.”</p><h3 id="Emergency-Departure"><a href="#Emergency-Departure" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Departure"></a>Emergency Departure</h3><p>The brothers don’t have much free time, but they still live quite colorfully. The brothers’ garrison dock is in the suburbs, separated from the city by sea, with several ferry services running daily. The city also has a navy dock, where another brother unit is stationed. Brothers there only need to walk a few hundred meters out of the dock area to reach the city’s commercial center, with streets full of colorful sights—really making us country folk envious and daydreaming.</p><p>Brothers on the suburban side usually have to walk half an hour to the ferry dock to take a boat across when they want to go to the city. Not only is it time-consuming and tiring, but they’re always worried it might suddenly depart. For many years, brothers at the suburban dock have been reporting to “above,” saying the water quality is poor, often causing “diarrhea and fast running” after drinking, strongly requesting to refill fresh water at the X-number dock across the way. Actually, brothers naturally know whether the suburban water quality is good or not, everyone tacitly agrees unanimously, but the political commissar comrade has sharp eyes. He often scolds the brothers, and in urgent moments reveals the truth with one sentence. Of course, he only pretends to be proper in front of the brothers, but also has plenty of complaints to outsiders.</p><p>“Above” naturally cares about the brothers’ health. Whenever the ship’s fresh water is below regulation, “above” arranges for the warship to dock at X dock to refill the high-quality water that city people drink. During the water refilling process, except for the compartment duty crew, other brothers basically have nothing to do. So the number of brothers requesting leave increases greatly, with reasons all over the place, and these reasons really move the duty officer, making them hard to refuse.</p><p>Every time we go to the city to refill water, we dock at noon and return before dinner, only allowing four or five hours of docking, not permitting overnight stays in the city, but four or five hours is enough for water refilling. After docking there many times like this, some brothers developed attachments to certain people in the city. Strangely, as the number of city water refilling trips increased, the water refilling speed became slower and slower, so slow that it required overnight to fill up. When asked, that damn squad leader answered that the water pressure was too low, only reaching sufficient pressure in the late night. So “above” also became understanding and went with the flow… Don’t look at brothers usually being somewhat playful, even playing with some disciplinary violations, but they never slack off in their work. Everyone can rest assured, and I dare guarantee that brothers are absolutely able to withstand any test.</p><p>Finally, one day, the test for the brothers came. That evening after dinner, we had just docked at the city dock to refill water when a dozen brothers, all slicked up with oiled hair and powdered faces, requested leave to go out, saying they wanted to buy books for studying. These kids’ new tricks were actually hard to refuse. Buying books for study naturally would be approved, but the brothers’ bodies covered in cheap perfume was very suspicious.</p><p>The kids deserved their bad luck. Not long after they left, trouble came. A certain observation and communication station reported that an unknown nationality ship had been loitering in international waters near our territorial sea line for several hours, making suspicious back-and-forth trips. It was judged to possibly be a reconnaissance ship from a certain country. “Above” ordered us to go for electronic interference, using both soft and hard methods—we wouldn’t withdraw until we drove them away.</p><p>Water refilling naturally couldn’t be completed, we had to immediately return to the suburban dock to load several “high-tech” items and install temporary equipment. The ship’s whistle really did call back several brothers who loved studying, but those brothers who loved studying even more weren’t so lucky. They were just a moment late returning and stood at the dock sighing and looking across the sea. Watching the colorful emergency signal lights light up on the warship mast across the bay, the kids were getting anxious and worked up. Taking the ferry probably wouldn’t make it in time, this sudden matter definitely wasn’t small. Although it was normal leave to go out, no brother wanted to miss this kind of “emergency state.” “Raise a master for a thousand days, use him for one moment”—the brothers all understood this principle. Several kids discussed and immediately took off their clothes, put them in plastic bags, and dove into the water. Not bragging, but this six or seven hundred meter distance wouldn’t be a problem for any brother on the ship.</p><p>As departure time approached and borrowed replacement personnel were already in position, ship brothers discovered several heads appearing and disappearing in the sea not far away. When the signal light shone over, they found it was their own brothers swimming toward the dock. Really didn’t see it coming—these kids, usually causing trouble for leaders, were really daring to think and act at this critical moment. “Not bad, good job”—this was the first time I heard the captain praise brothers. Fortunately, the tide wasn’t strong, and the kids quickly swam to the ship’s side, threw down ropes, and the ship service officer directed brothers to pull them aboard with all hands. I was born to love joining in the excitement, and when I went to look, I was greatly shocked—the kids were all completely naked, each exposing their three points. One brother’s equipment was particularly special, really as big as in legends, really opening my eyes—such a giant thing really exists in this world. While opening my eyes, I also thought of my hometown’s famous dish, donkey three pieces…</p><p>Other brothers naturally weren’t interested in donkey tails and horse heads, so they scattered back to their posts. The warship departed on time, with no one “falling off the dock.” During the voyage, the ship service officer suddenly had a whim and went down to the kitchen alone to personally cook extra meals for those guys, saying swimming consumes the most energy, had to supplement the kids. I was greedy, and after hearing the news, I shamelessly grabbed bowls and chopsticks and rushed to the kitchen. Before entering, I saw that old miser holding a kitchen knife in his right hand and a big radish in his left, gesturing while talking to himself: “When his thing gets hard, it’s probably this big.” As he spoke, the kitchen knife came down heavily, cutting the radish in half. I was greatly shocked, protected my private parts with the bowl and fled in panic…</p><h3 id="About-the-“Ship-Service-Officer”"><a href="#About-the-“Ship-Service-Officer”" class="headerlink" title="About the “Ship Service Officer”"></a>About the “Ship Service Officer”</h3><p>I remember when I first joined the navy, I studied a course called “Ship Common Subjects,” which were the common rules mentioned earlier. I casually flipped through the textbook and had a general understanding of the content. This course mainly relied on rote memorization to pass the exam. At that time, I was also in charge of a vegetable plot in the district team, and most of my free time was devoted to those radishes and cabbages. Before the exam, I crammed a bit and actually passed smoothly, only getting one question about the ship service officer wrong, losing quite a few points.</p><p>In August, during assignment, brothers took a troop transport ship to an unfamiliar dock, with notification that each ship’s captain would personally collect the new brothers. At the last moment, a fat “captain” came, picked up my luggage, and threw down a sentence: “The warship is in factory maintenance, you’re lucky, kid.” Looking at his fat back, I secretly rejoiced—this warship probably had the best food. Following that fat guy onto a landing craft, half an hour later we arrived at the factory. Before getting off the craft, the fat guy went to the craft’s kitchen, casually grabbed a large piece of pork ribs, and said to the craft captain: “You don’t need to return the few cabbages I borrowed last time.” After saying this, he turned and left, making the craft captain jump and curse on the bridge. How could this damn captain be so stingy and lack grace? I was embarrassed for him too.</p><p>Later I learned that the captain and political commissar had business that day, and the fat guy who came to pick me up was the head of the ship service department—the ship service officer. This person was surnamed Zhang, from Shandong. Brothers called him Fat Zhang, Chief, or Old Miser in different situations. He was also the person with the most nicknames I’ve ever seen. When joking with brothers, you could call him Fat Zhang; if you had something to ask of him, call him Chief, and your matter would be half done; when he made brothers unhappy, brothers would curse him as Old Miser behind his back. Strangely, he never spoke Shandong dialect but spoke authentic Henan dialect, making his unclear hometown quite suspicious. He often complained to new brothers: when he was very young, he was greedy and followed a malt candy vendor to Henan, and later that vendor somehow became his parent. This speech made brothers shed tears and feel great sympathy for him. At this time, he would definitely “haha” laugh, turn his head and leave, making brothers laugh and cry, unable to tell if it was true or false.</p><p>There are good and bad legends about Fat Zhang. According to the political commissar who knew him well, Fat Zhang was among the last batch of officers promoted without going through military academies. He was originally a volunteer soldier on another ship, serving as a cooking squad leader, cooking excellent dishes. He was also diligent, often getting up before dawn to clean the dock. Over time, he was noticed by several brigade leaders who came for morning exercise. Every time leaders came to inspect the dock, they would specifically request to eat on his ship at noon, saying eating his cooked dishes satisfied their cravings and was enjoyable. When asked about his cooking secrets, he would blurt out like telling family history: “Cooking doesn’t need learning, just big fire and lots of oil”—really clean and neat.</p><p>Perhaps because the ship service department wasn’t very professional, or for other reasons, Fat Zhang was exceptionally promoted to be our ship’s ship service officer, managing the ship’s logistics and the dozen or so brothers in the sail and cable squad. Theoretically, the military doctor and health worker should also be his subordinates, but the old guy was only interested in places that used money. Captain, ship service officer—one character difference, plus the old guy’s body type, really caused many jokes. The strangest was once transporting a newly appointed base leader to inspect a certain island warehouse. At that time, there were no military ranks, and that damn leader’s appearance was far less impressive than Fat Zhang’s. After docking, officials accompanied the leader up the gangway. At the end of the gangway, the warehouse leader ran over and went straight to Fat Zhang, standing at attention and saluting: “Report, Comrade Chief, all officers and soldiers of XX warehouse have assembled, awaiting your instructions”… Brothers on the ship not far away covered their mouths laughing so hard they wanted to pee. From then on, this “Chief’s” fame spread far and wide, and the stories became more and more magical.</p><p>Fat Zhang was absolutely a competent housekeeper, calculating carefully, with no criticism of his work from top to bottom. For example, he thought the supply station’s vegetables were too expensive, so he secretly went to the market to contact vegetable vendors for delivery. Many nearby vegetable vendors knew that the navy had a fat captain who personally came to bargain, very difficult to deal with. For this, the sergeant specifically responsible for buying vegetables had his cigarette quality drop straight down, cursing him behind his back. As for shortcomings, he had plenty. He often didn’t care about the occasion and used his left hand to pull “that place” through his pants. Conscientious brothers counted for him—on average, he pulled more than ten times per hour. Brothers were naturally curious and wanted to see in the bathhouse, but over several years they never succeeded—he was deliberately avoiding brothers. He also had another problem: when doing business outside, he often promoted himself without authorization. The method was quite simple—when introducing himself, he would omit one “service” character, and he could be promoted several levels. According to his theory, higher rank makes things easier to handle. Brothers thought about it and felt there was some truth to it. He was sincere with brothers, and brothers certainly covered for him in everything. When he was dating his first girlfriend, he corresponded for half a year without meeting. How he bragged about himself in the letters isn’t clear. One day, the girl suddenly came to the unit to see him, and happened to meet the clerk at the dock sentry post, saying she wanted to find Captain Zhang of XXX ship. Fortunately, the clerk had been flattering for many years and was quick-witted, instantly determining the visitor’s identity, first stabilizing her, then rushing back to the ship to report the enemy situation. Soon, this “Captain Zhang” personally came to the sentry post to welcome his girlfriend aboard for a tour. When boarding, the armed guard gave a captain’s boarding salute, and dinner was even enjoyed in the captain’s cabin with the military doctor personally serving. Brothers calling “Captain Zhang” one after another made Fat Zhang quite uncomfortable. Face was given to him, but it still didn’t work out. According to the captain and political commissar: “I always felt this was too risky.” Actually, she thought his body type was too fat and didn’t fit international trends, and her ex-boyfriend was a butcher.</p><p>Fat Zhang was just over thirty, but looked like he was in his forties. Combined with his unclear background, some brothers suspected his age was fake, but more brothers were anxious and worried for him. Every time this was mentioned, he would pretend to want to get angry, but fortunately brothers understood him well, and it passed with laughter. In my impression, Fat Zhang really did get angry once, and it was that big anger that finally resolved brothers’ years of confusion. That time was during swimming, when he dove too aggressively, and the water’s resistance pulled off his swim trunks. A brother picked them up and absolutely refused to return them, throwing them to the shore. Fat Zhang was furious, chasing that brother naked to the shore, scaring the brother half to death, covering his head and fleeing like a rat. The next day, all the ship’s brothers were quietly discussing a certain part of Fat Zhang, talking while extending their little fingers to gesture, very mysterious. From that day on, brothers avoided using words like peanuts and silkworm pupae in front of him…</p><p>Fat Zhang served as ship service officer for many years, with outstanding work achievements. Brothers all fantasized that he would be promoted and reused earlier; they also hoped he would have a breakthrough in his personal life, getting a “dock” to dock at. Sure enough, a year later, just before I was about to leave that warship, the base finally announced orders that Fat Zhang was promoted and appointed as deputy political commissar on another warship. Our ship’s brothers were sad for a few days, then all became happy again. It turned out that the new position required him to also assist in managing the ship service department. Seems the old guy really couldn’t jump out of this circle. According to Fat Zhang’s words: “Promotion or not, it’s all the same damn thing.”</p><h3 id="Photography-Incident"><a href="#Photography-Incident" class="headerlink" title="Photography Incident"></a>Photography Incident</h3><p>Now things are really open, tourists can take cameras and snap away at whatever interests them. Seeing some good photos online that are clearly taken by brothers is really impressive. In previous years, living standards were far below what they are now, and buying a camera would cost brothers a lot of money. The first camera I bought cost four months of my salary. It was a Shanghai-made twin-lens reflex camera, really a pity that it didn’t stay with me for long.</p><p>After that photographer sparked the brothers’ interest in photography, I also gritted my teeth and bought a camera. Although I didn’t produce any masterpieces, it brought the brothers a lot of fun. After each shooting session, I would go to the team’s self-built darkroom to develop and enlarge the photos myself. Watching those human figures slowly emerge under the red light made me feel extremely proud.</p><p>Once during a sea voyage, we came to a submarine base for anti-submarine training. I used the training rest periods to leave many beautiful memories for the brothers. I can’t remember which evening it was, but several brothers were taking photos of each other on the military port’s breakwater when a submarine happened to be returning from training. The smooth hull of the submarine, illuminated by low-angle sunlight, looked exceptionally beautiful, truly like a painting. We brothers didn’t have time to consider anything else, several cameras simultaneously aimed at that returning submarine and took a series of shots. We wanted to take a few more photos, but disaster struck without us realizing it. Someone on that submarine shouted loudly to the shore sentry, telling the sentry to detain the brothers. Actually, brothers knew that photography was prohibited within military ports, especially taking photos of warships and submarines. But each military port had different standards, and in many military ports, brothers taking a few photos wouldn’t be bothered. Today we happened to meet a real stickler.</p><p>Before the sentry arrived, brothers quickly ran back to the ship to hide. Unexpectedly, this hiding made the situation worse. Brothers thought at the time that the submarine people’s shouting was just to stop the photography, and they wouldn’t pursue it afterward. When that submarine docked, a group of people who looked like leaders came down and cursed the dock sentry to pieces. Later we learned that the shouting leader was that base’s “everything he says makes noise” person. Perhaps our fleeing behavior angered him, and he went to find our ship’s captain and political commissar despite his fatigue from being at sea, requesting assistance in investigating which bold individuals were responsible. After all, we weren’t from the same unit, so their attitude toward the captain and political commissar was still polite. The duty officer assembled all ship brothers, repeated the policy “confession gets strict punishment, resistance gets even stricter” three times, asking which individuals did it to step forward voluntarily. We had already been frightened, our legs trembling, how could we dare step forward? This made them lose face, and they left dejectedly.</p><p>Even more frightening things came early the next morning. That base actually mobilized security department personnel to investigate, really making a mountain out of a molehill. Looking at their approach, they wouldn’t give up until they found out. Brothers were doomed. The saying “confession gets strict punishment, resistance gets even stricter” was indeed correct. Brothers were really too frightened and had no choice but to choose confession for strict punishment.</p><p>Brothers suffered disaster, and the captain and political commissar also lost face. They brought several unfortunate brothers to that base’s headquarters, gave a bunch of nonsense about poor ship discipline and future strict requirements, then let them handle it as they pleased. Several brothers also made up their minds, putting on an attitude of “a dead pig isn’t afraid of boiling water”…</p><p>The security personnel, not knowing their place, started talking like officials. First, the attitude of admitting mistakes was bad. Therefore, this damn matter was classified as an “incident,” requiring a deep self-criticism; second, cancel several brothers’ qualifications to go to sea with submarines for experience; third, temporarily confiscate the cameras, to be retrieved when your ship returns based on the self-criticism.</p><p>Fortunately, we weren’t from the same unit, otherwise we would have lost a layer of black skin. On the way back, the captain and political commissar also felt it was a bit excessive and expressed sympathy for the brothers. Half a month later, brothers finally returned to base and left that damn place. Because they didn’t want to see those security personnel’s “official talk” again, brothers didn’t go to retrieve those cameras.</p><p>To be honest, I’m naturally thick-skinned and didn’t care about that submarine sea experience opportunity—as long as the green mountain remains, there’s no fear of running out of firewood. I just have deep feelings of missing that camera, it appeared in several of my dreams, it was after all my “first time.” I don’t know if it’s still alive in this world, how is it doing?</p><h3 id="Small-Town-Stories"><a href="#Small-Town-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Small Town Stories"></a>Small Town Stories</h3><p>Now technology is really advanced. Sitting indoors, with just a click of the mouse, you can know all the world’s major events. Especially being able to appreciate the progress of new ship construction recorded by brothers online with cameras is really inspiring. During the National Day holiday, TV programs were really disappointing—among dozens of channels, you couldn’t find anything to your taste.</p><p>I remember many years ago, “above” assigned more than ten of us brothers to a heroic unit that had repeatedly distinguished itself in battle. I was assigned to a warship that had participated in famous battles. The unit also had a small dock in a famous town near Hong Kong. The dock garrison was very simple, basically without cultural and entertainment facilities. Every time warships passed by during patrol training, they would stay here briefly to replenish fresh water. The dock had a small military commissary, but there weren’t many things brothers could afford to buy. Not far from the dock was the town’s commercial center, where things were cheap and varied. Saying that small town was famous was definitely not an exaggeration. From the first day we were assigned to this unit, leaders big and small warned brothers that the civilians in this bird town mostly watched Hong Kong TV programs, with content full of yellow and vulgar things that made people sick. To prevent brothers from accidentally watching those “sickening” programs, every time we passed through here, temporary regulations were issued prohibiting anyone from going out at night, and brothers who went out during the day had to return to the ship before dinner. From then on, those TV programs became extremely mysterious in the brothers’ hearts.</p><p>One summer, brothers were being driven crazy by various exams when suddenly came excellent news—brothers were to cooperate with a fast boat unit for training, and the training area was just offshore from that small town, lasting one month. This type of training was actually very simple—early departure, late return, just being good sparring partners would complete the mission. So, in the few days before departure, brothers’ bedtime topics naturally turned to this small town. Some brothers tearfully swore they would definitely “sacrifice myself” to go “get sickened” once.</p><p>Several hours of sailing brought brothers to the predetermined sea area. A fast boat came alongside, bringing several bird people from the fast boat unit. Going up to the command bridge, they installed several instruments I didn’t understand, and one fat bird person began giving orders. Strangely, the people from the fast boat unit were all plump and chubby, either having good food or not having been to sea for a long time. Really made people envious.</p><p>Training finally officially began. The warship sailed according to the predetermined course, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, welcoming attacks from those several fast boats. The sea was quite rough, and the first day of training gave those fat guys a lesson, making them vomit until they were disoriented. The captain had a soft heart and urgently ordered the cooking squad to prepare pickled vegetables—folk remedies were most effective at this time. Those bird people constantly adjusted instruments, shouting “xxxx number hit target.” Seeing those fat guys’ proud expressions, I felt uncomfortable and used binoculars to observe the surroundings, but couldn’t even see a shadow of fast boats. Going to the radar room, the fluorescent screen actually showed hundreds of moving targets. Mixed with fishing boats, they really weren’t easy to distinguish. Indeed, they were all experts, not to be underestimated. After a day, according to those bird people’s statistics, our ship was “hit” more than ten times. The captain was depressed, calling himself unlucky…</p><p>After training was finished, as brothers wished, we came to that small town. Since it was a single ship berthing, the dock seemed empty. After dinner, some brothers tried to request leave, with absolutely tear-jerking reasons. The leadership comrades were indeed formidable, not letting brothers even fart, gathering what brothers wanted to do and having the clerk go out to handle everything uniformly. During the golden time in the evening, brothers were assembled on the dock, and after roll call, the military doctor personally took charge, directing brothers to sing revolutionary songs…</p><p>After singing military songs, brothers gathered on the aft deck, anxiously looking at the nearby residential buildings, only worrying about the clerk who went out shopping—what if that kid “vomited continuously,” how would we handle it? One brother who had sworn stepped forward, volunteering to go find him. Revolutionary comrades were truly like brothers, showing true feelings at critical moments—I was deeply moved. But how could that kid avoid the sentry’s fiery eyes…</p><p>The clerk returned on time, and brothers gathered around, caring and asking exactly how many times he had “vomited.” Seeing the clerk sweating profusely, lips trembling, absolutely refusing to admit he had watched “sickening” programs, brothers concluded that the leaders were right—those TV programs were indeed very toxic, even the politically sound clerk couldn’t handle it and ended up in such a state…</p><p>That kid who went out to find someone finally returned, lying on his bed board talking about how he bought a pack of cigarettes and watched TV for several hours, but not saying a word about the “sickening” program content brothers were most concerned about. No matter how brothers used both soft and hard tactics, that kid just smirked and remained silent—really deeply poisoned.</p><p>For several days in a row, those military songs were sung by brothers over and over eight hundred times. Really having no more songs to sing, after dinner brothers were allowed to chat and talk nonsense. That kid followed the same pattern, playing a disappearing game with brothers, and each time returning before bedtime. When he returned, the kid would dance and gesture, still muttering words—very strange. Brothers unanimously concluded that this comrade’s virus had entered his marrow, in critical condition.</p><p>To save this comrade, some brothers reported to the ship’s leadership. Leaders collectively talked to him several times. Surprisingly, after the talks, there was no reaction on the ship, not even a self-criticism from him. That evening, this comrade even swaggered out the main gate with the political commissar…</p><p>Saturday extra meal, the military doctor as usual secretly drank several small cups of wine. Taking advantage of the alcohol, he announced explosive news: from tonight on, brothers would watch those Hong Kong TV station programs, but brothers weren’t allowed to spread the word—if anything happened, he would take the blame. The fishbone antenna had been bought back and would be installed after dinner. Brothers were shocked when they heard this…</p><p>After setting up the antenna, brothers couldn’t wait to turn on the TV. After tuning several TV stations, they still couldn’t find those “sickening” programs. Instead, a TV series called “Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils” attracted brothers’ attention all evening. Unfortunately, brothers mostly couldn’t understand that Hong Kong bird talk…</p><p>More than twenty days later, brothers successfully completed the training mission and returned to base. During that time, brothers developed another strange habit—when two people met, they would use hands and feet to “cough, cough” and start fighting, only stopping when one person fled in defeat. Brothers on neighboring ships saw this and discussed it, greatly puzzled…</p><h3 id="Oil-Tanker-Incident"><a href="#Oil-Tanker-Incident" class="headerlink" title="Oil Tanker Incident"></a>Oil Tanker Incident</h3><p>In naval training bases, you can sometimes see brothers wearing other military branch uniforms training. In previous years, you could even see some foreign sailors. At first it seemed strange, but later I learned that ships weren’t the navy’s exclusive domain. Through these uniforms, you could see that various branches and even the armed police had their own ship fleets. Those colorful uniforms really stood out and looked good among the navy crowd.</p><p>Every time brothers returned from sea missions, the ship would add several dishes, and before meals the captain and political commissar would say some old-fashioned polite words to encourage everyone to continue working hard. Really testing brothers—with delicacies from land and sea laid out before you, you still had to drool and patiently listen to some nonsense you could recite backwards. After many times, brothers’ weak will couldn’t resist the temptation of the dishes. Often before those standing finished speaking, those squatting had already secretly eaten. You couldn’t blame brothers for being greedy—when people spend a long time at sea, all the oil in their stomachs goes to the sea. But I remember one time, when brothers returned from sea, there were the same good dishes, but not a single brother could eat them, because brothers’ hearts were sad—no one expected the result to be so cruel and merciless…</p><p>It was also during a year’s winter training, coming to a certain island’s sea area. Several warships were conducting formation air defense training when suddenly an emergency order was received, ordering our two warships to stop training and rush at full speed to a certain sea area. The captain didn’t dare delay, urgently accelerated to break away from the formation, following the command ship at full speed toward a strait direction. During the voyage, a boarding team was announced, with light weapons and ammunition distributed. Brothers were puzzled—had the training subject been changed? After the political commissar’s brief introduction, brothers understood. It turned out that an oil tanker from our air force, fully loaded with fuel, was passing through that strait. When it reached the strait exit, the bird ship suddenly stopped and deviated from the channel, drifting toward a large island. That was a sensitive sea area where passing warships had to sound battle alerts and be ready to fight at any time. Brothers knew the consequences if that oil tanker drifted over there. According to that captain, the main engine had malfunctioned and was being repaired, and dropping both anchors was useless. Perhaps “above” considered the problem more deeply than brothers—what happened next made brothers even more unbearable.</p><p>The battle alert bell with two short sounds was even more different than usual. The bell told brothers this wasn’t an exercise. Soon the oil tanker was found. Approaching for observation, it really looked like the main engine had stopped. The ship body was floating up and down in the swells, and the bow was retracting anchor chains. Not far away, two enemy warships were also monitoring brothers’ every move. In the sky, two of our fighter planes were circling. Brothers saw clearly that the fighter planes were loaded with eggs. “Above” ordered boarding and had brothers control that oil tanker. Some brothers used the excuse that the waves were too big, unwilling to jump over with guns, but military orders were hard to disobey…</p><p>After taking over the oil tanker, the tanker’s captain and political instructor were sweating profusely with anxiety. Their chief engineer was covered in oil, cursing some factory… You could see they had also tried their best. Brothers secured the cables and implemented towing deployment. It was really difficult for this type of ship that could only run fast—towing such a heavy burden, it could only slowly leave that ghostly place…</p><p>Finally the tugboat arrived, and the captain was ordered to invite the captain, political instructor, and chief engineer to “jump” to our ship for “tea.” These three air force old brothers seemed to sense something and all dressed neatly to enter our ship’s conference room. I was curious and went to make tea to entertain them, actually discovering they were all wearing wool uniforms—the green wool uniforms were really beautiful. I proposed exchanging a set, and the captain’s answer made my heart ache: “I’m afraid this is the last set. If nothing happens this time, I’ll give you a set.”</p><p>Returning to the base dock, air force personnel were already waiting with serious expressions. Under brothers’ watchful eyes, the three people were “invited” into a jeep and rushed away. Brothers were speechless. According to brothers who had been in the engine room, that ship’s main engine was indeed severely damaged, something like a bird crankshaft fracture… It seemed various investigations were unavoidable. Hopefully they could pass smoothly.</p><p>Brothers never imagined that after the successful completion of this mission, the result would be like this. That evening as usual there were extra dishes, but without the leaders’ pre-meal nonsense, brothers also couldn’t eat due to sadness in their hearts. They were all too kind… A month later, good news came that after expert inspection, that oil tanker had indeed experienced a sudden malfunction with no signs of sabotage. The captain and others passed smoothly. I remember that evening’s dinner had temporary extra dishes, and many brothers secretly drank up the military doctor’s bottle of treasured tonic wine that had been stored for many years, making the military doctor curse for three days…</p><p>That ship was still seen in previous years, but in recent years its whereabouts are unknown. I still remember that set of air force wool uniform. If I meet that captain, I will definitely shamelessly continue asking for it, not giving up until I achieve my goal.</p><p>Surprisingly, on a warship full of storytelling masters, this incident was the only one that brothers never mentioned again. Perhaps brothers had poor memories and had completely forgotten.</p><p>(End)</p></div><div class="comment-divider"></div><script src="https://giscus.app/client.js" data-lang="en" data-repo="liuzane&#x2F;liuzane.github.io" data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTY3ODEyNDM&#x3D;" data-category="Announcements" data-category-id="DIC_kwDODOvRu84CwfsS" data-mapping="title" data-strict="1" data-reactions-enabled="1" data-emit-metadata="0" data-input-position="top" data-theme="preferred_color_scheme" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script></article></section><footer id="footer" class="frosted-glass"><div class="footer-wrapper"><a href="/" class="footer-title">Zane&#39;s Blog</a><p>This little world was built by me</p></div></footer></div></div><script src="/js/i18n.js"></script></div></body></html>
