When I was applying to university, international trade was one of the hottest majors, and everyone believed this major was easy to make money. But now graduates from this major find it very difficult to get a good job. Shanghai has listed it as one of the 10 warning majors, meaning one of the ten most difficult majors to find employment.</p><p><img src="./hen-and-front-end-engineer/bg2016072601.jpg" alt=" "></p><p>However, not all industries are struggling. At least one industry has extremely strong labor demand, with job advertisements everywhere, and job positions are several times the number of applicants. Usually, you have several companies to choose from. Every week, friends send messages asking if I can help introduce some people, saying they’re really short on staff.</p><p>This industry is called internet development.</p><p>2.</p><p>The labor demand in the internet industry can be described as a “labor shortage.”</p><p>As long as you can make web pages, especially mobile app pages or WeChat activity pages, you won’t worry about finding a job. Even if you’ve only learned for a few months or just graduated from a training class, as long as you can show your work, you’ll get a starting salary much higher than other industries. After gaining one or two years of work experience, the salary can reach the level of university professors.</p><p>With such employment prospects, how can people not flock to it? Despite tens of thousands of newcomers joining every year, internet companies are still shouting that engineers are severely short.</p><p>I used to not understand why web development engineers (or “frontend engineers”) are so in demand. Until one day, I saw a set of egg statistics and finally figured out this problem.</p><p><img src="./hen-and-front-end-engineer/bg2016072602.jpg" alt=" "></p><p>China is the world’s largest egg producer. According to statistics, the national production in 2013 was 575 billion eggs, with each Chinese person eating an average of over 400 eggs per year.</p><p>So how many hens does China need to achieve such production?</p><p><img src="./hen-and-front-end-engineer/bg2016072603.jpg" alt=" "></p><p>It’s said that ordinary hens lay about 200-250 eggs per year. The best hens in chicken farms can reach 320 eggs per year. Calculating with 250 eggs, China needs at least 2.3 billion hens to meet the national demand for eggs.</p><p><img src="./hen-and-front-end-engineer/bg2016072604.jpg" alt=" "></p><p>4.</p><p>If we replace eggs with web pages, the same question is: how many web pages does China need to produce per year to meet people’s consumption needs?</p><p>Last year, China had over 1.3 billion mobile phone users and over 600 million smartphone users. Even if only half of them go online, that’s still over 300 million people. These people spend dozens of minutes or several hours every day using mobile phones to go online. The number of web pages and apps consumed by all Chinese people in a year is an astronomical figure.</p><p><img src="./hen-and-front-end-engineer/bg2016072605.jpg" alt=" "></p><p>Eggs are laid by hens, but where do web pages come from? Ultimately, all pages need to be made by engineers. So many internet companies, each company needs frontend engineers. But the total number of frontend engineers nationwide is probably only several hundred thousand, which is definitely far from enough compared to such a large content consumption volume (think about it, there are 2.3 billion hens nationwide). Thinking about it this way, it’s no wonder engineers are in high demand.</p><p>There’s another very important reason: schools don’t teach frontend development. There might be some related courses, but they don’t teach it systematically. All frontend engineers are self-taught. This also leads to a shortage in supply.</p><p>5.</p><p>Due to easy job finding and higher salaries, frontend engineers have now become a hot profession. Many people who don’t work in computers are also considering changing careers to join. Training classes in society, various lectures and conferences every weekend, are all packed.</p><p>I often receive emails asking whether they should change careers.</p><blockquote><p>“I am an accountant/teacher/tour guide, and my current job has no sense of achievement. I feel there’s no room for development. If I spend about a year self-studying frontend courses, can I become a programmer in the future?”</p></blockquote><p>How should I answer this?</p><p>6.</p><p>Frontend programming entry is indeed not difficult and can be achieved quickly in a short time. As long as you have a basic understanding of computers, even with zero programming foundation, after three or four months of training, you can make web pages and apps.</p><p>If you really want to change careers, I think it’s basically a good thing. You should choose those more promising professions. But the problem is that not everyone is suitable for programming. With so many people now flocking to learn internet development, some will definitely regret it in the future.</p><p>You’d better know the following three things before considering joining this industry.</p><p>7.</p><p>First, you should love programming.</p><p>Professional programmers must sit in front of computers for long hours every day, spending far more time talking to machines than to people. If you don’t genuinely love programming, this will be very hard to endure, almost like a punishment. Making someone work exhaustingly for years or even decades on something they don’t like, what a painful life that would be.</p><p>Second, although programming itself is an intellectual activity, the reality in China is more like physical labor.</p><p>Due to too many operational activities, development work is endless, and apps must constantly release new versions. The workload is often overloaded, with tasks scheduled one after another, with no breathing room in between. Working on multiple projects simultaneously is also common. Each project has deadlines, and if you can’t finish, you can only work overtime. Let me put it this way: making web pages itself is interesting, but “manufacturing” web pages like an assembly line is boring, like hens in a chicken farm constantly laying eggs, having to complete the target of 5 eggs per week.</p><p>Finally, this industry has very fast metabolism.</p><p>Rapid technological updates and extremely high work intensity give young people natural advantages. When your development speed starts to slow down in the later stages of your career, that’s when you’ll be replaced by younger people. A hen can lay about 2000 eggs in its lifetime, and the number of web pages (or apps) you can make in your lifetime is probably also a constant.</p><p>8.</p><p>If you don’t like programming, can’t appreciate the joy and sense of achievement of code, and just come to do it for a good salary, that’s a very bad choice. Think about it: if ten years ago, you heard that international trade was booming and filled in international trade for your college application, what would happen today?</p><p>You should choose those professions that generate the most interest and passion in you. Because in the future, all industries’ low-end, low-skill positions will be replaced by machines. Only those with the strongest skills and most creativity won’t be eliminated. Interest, and only interest, will give you tireless passion, drive you to study deeper, and make you more excellent.</p><p>(End)</p></div><div class="article-divider"></div><script src="https://giscus.app/client.js" data-lang="en" data-repo="liuzane&#x2F;liuzane.github.io" data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTY3ODEyNDM&#x3D;" data-category="Announcements" data-category-id="DIC_kwDODOvRu84CwfsS" data-mapping="title" data-strict="1" data-reactions-enabled="1" data-emit-metadata="0" data-input-position="top" data-theme="preferred_color_scheme" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script></article></section><footer id="footer" class="frosted-glass"><div class="footer-wrapper"><a href="/" class="footer-title">Zane&#39;s Blog</a><p>This small world built by me</p></div></footer></div></div></div><script src="/js/i18n.js"></script></body></html>
