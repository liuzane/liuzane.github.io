My first job was at a small startup where we owned many physical servers. Now, it’s hard to imagine any web startup directly managing servers; people just click a few buttons and links on the Amazon AWS console.”</p></blockquote><p>The development of frameworks has also reduced the need to write code from scratch.</p><blockquote><p>“Programmers used to have to build things from scratch, but the development speed of software libraries has exceeded our usage speed. Even software can generate new software itself, which is why you see so many ‘no-code’ or ‘low-code’ solutions suddenly appearing. Now, there are fewer and fewer reasons to write code yourself; you just need to integrate different products together.”</p></blockquote><p>His conclusion is that <strong>the development of software automation technology may reduce the demand for software engineers, and there may be fewer programmers in the future than there are now.</strong></p><p><strong>2.</strong></p><p>I’m very interested in this topic because it’s predicting major future changes and is directly related to employment trends. If future software scaling and automation will suppress the demand for programmers, then we shouldn’t encourage young people to become programmers.</p><p>The Hacker News forum had a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23297463">heated discussion</a> about this article. Most people (all professional programmers) believe that <strong>this view has been expressed for decades and is simply unnecessary worry; the reality is quite the opposite, with programmers becoming more and more numerous.</strong></p><blockquote><p>“When I was 10, I started coding with Qbasic. I told my dad I wanted to be a programmer when I grew up. He told me that computers might soon become automated, like his engineering industry, and I would have to find another job.<br>But 23 years have passed, and the market demand for programmers continues to rise and seems to still be rising.<br>I want to say that we are still far from the level of abstraction where software automatically solves most needs. As the article says, new tools like k8s, docker, kafka, databricks, redshift have replaced many programmers. But they actually trigger more demand for programmers.<br>The problems that must be solved by programmers have just moved to new places.”</p></blockquote><p>As the above quote says, the reality is that problems requiring programming solutions are not decreasing but increasing, leading to an increase in programmers. The two arguments proposed in the original article don’t hold water.</p><p>First, cloud services do indeed free enterprises from server management, but you still need people who understand docker, kubernetes, database sharding and indexing, failover, backup, message queues, and other technologies. Even though these things are now more integrated and easier to combine, figuring out how they interact and how to set them up is still a very complex matter.</p><p>Second, “no-code development” can only solve some general software problems. Sooner or later, customization will be needed. At that time, programmers will be needed to modify the code so users can continue using it.</p><p>In short, the world is becoming increasingly automated, and the essence of automation is software, so the demand for programmers can only increase, not decrease.</p><p><strong>3.</strong></p><p>However, there are also a few people on the forum who agree with the original author’s view, believing that the increase in programmers is only a past situation and may not be the case in the future. <strong>Now may be a time point for a “mutation” in software development, and future development may be different from previous situations.</strong></p><p>It’s true that the market needs more people who understand new tools like docker and kubernetes. But mainly large companies need such people; small companies don’t need kubernetes. The complexity small companies face is limited; they just need to use simple solutions provided by large companies, with almost no need to develop their own parts.</p><p>Moreover, if a company’s business focus is not on technology (you should know that most companies are not internet companies), using “no-code solutions” is most effective. Because you can quickly apply them without spending much money on software engineering.</p><p>Historically, whenever a field has many problems requiring programming solutions, a general solution emerges that solves 90% of the scenarios. Then, the demand for programmers in that field quickly decreases.</p><blockquote><p>“30 years ago, developing GUI interfaces was difficult; Visual Basic changed that.<br>20 years ago, making a web application was difficult; PHP changed that.<br>10 years ago, writing complex web layouts was difficult; Bootstrap changed that.<br>Now, machine learning is difficult; PyTorch is changing that.<br>Every tricky problem eventually produces an effective solution that solves 90% of scenarios. For most companies, this solution is sufficient. For the remaining 10% of scenarios, some are solved by certain companies paying programmers, while others are never solved.”</p></blockquote><p>So, if new fields emerge endlessly, then more programmers will be needed. However, the demand for programmers in these fields won’t be lasting; once solutions are produced, demand will quickly decrease.</p><p><strong>4.</strong></p><p>After reading the above discussion, my thoughts are that how the market demand for programmers changes in the future cannot be simply answered as increase or decrease, but depends on two factors.</p><p><strong>(1) Whether the speed of people’s demand increase can exceed the evolution speed of software automation.</strong></p><p>Existing scenarios will eventually have general solutions, and situations requiring hiring programmers will indeed become fewer and fewer. Programmers’ employment mainly relies on newly emerging scenarios. Moreover, the speed of new scenario increase must exceed the evolution speed of software automation; otherwise, old solutions might upgrade themselves into solutions for new scenarios.</p><p><strong>(2) The difficulty of software development must exceed the evolution speed of machine learning.</strong></p><p>The number of programmers is also related to the difficulty of software development. The lower the difficulty, the more people will engage in this work. Previously, you had to understand computer hardware and assembly language to develop software, so there were few programmers. Now, software development is becoming easier and easier, no longer requiring understanding of the underlying layers, just needing to understand a certain framework, so more and more ordinary people become programmers.</p><p>Future programming will definitely become easier and easier, but easier programming also means machines can easily replace people to complete these tasks. So, the difficulty of software development must exceed the level of machine learning; otherwise, the increase in demand will only lead to more machine automatic programming, not more programmer hiring.</p><p>(End)</p></div><div class="article-divider"></div><script src="https://giscus.app/client.js" data-lang="en" data-repo="liuzane&#x2F;liuzane.github.io" data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTY3ODEyNDM&#x3D;" data-category="Announcements" data-category-id="DIC_kwDODOvRu84CwfsS" data-mapping="title" data-strict="1" data-reactions-enabled="1" data-emit-metadata="0" data-input-position="top" data-theme="preferred_color_scheme" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script></article></section><footer id="footer" class="frosted-glass"><div class="footer-wrapper"><a href="/" class="footer-title">Zane&#39;s Blog</a><p>This small world built by me</p></div></footer></div></div></div><script src="/js/i18n.js"></script></body></html>
